            I am reading *<strong>How to Make Better Decisions in Life and Work</strong>* by Chip & Dan Heath, and one of the chapters discusses
            making deliberate mistakes to test whether decisions you hold as correct indeed are.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "An assumption is something that we believe to be true and think will hold true under certain conditions."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            This got me thinking about the assumptions we often take for granted while testing. Assumptions can become habits—things we
            no longer recognize as assumptions but instead hold as truths. This is a dangerous thing in testing because, over time,
            those assumptions become the foundation of our decisions, and any failure could be catastrophic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider when you assume your computer will work as before after an update, only to find that upgrading the OS from Lion to
            Maverick breaks your Java installation, rendering the JDK—and your automated tests—useless.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Minimize the Impact of Assumptions?</h2>
        <p>
            The book suggests testing assumptions from time to time. How? By deliberately doing the opposite of what you believe to be
            true. For instance, my commute often involves biking from point A to point B. I assume that route X1 is the quickest because
            it is shorter. But occasionally, I deliberately take routes X2 or X3 to test this assumption.
        </p>
        <p>
            Testing an assumption may waste time or effort, but it often yields valuable insights. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It might confirm my initial assumption: X1 is the fastest route.</li>
            <li>I may discover X2 is quicker due to fewer traffic lights or more cycle-friendly paths.</li>
            <li>It broadens my perspective, helping me see the usual route with fresh eyes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Value of Testing Assumptions</h2>
        <p>
            Even if testing assumptions occasionally results in failure, it is essential to ensure that our habits are purposeful. By
            making deliberate mistakes, we validate the relevance of our paths and ensure they remain effective.
