        <p>
            Here I have a blog post, <a href="testYourAssumption.html">Test your assumptions</a>, a brief article on doing things differently from time to time<br>
            While practising Node.js and data analysis I had a go at calculating the distribution of TFL tube stations and Santander bike points in London, here at<a href="properMapPage.html"> the map page</a><br>
            This is another data adventure with <a href="anAdventureInData.html">data in the wild</a><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="statuses.html">This page </a> has a list of most HTTP status codes. Go on the page to see how you can use it.
            The button below, as an example, calls a lambda stored in AWS and sends the http status to the browser
            <button class="btnStyle" onclick="callLambda(200)">HTTP code 200</button>
            <section class="status_section"> </section>
            For all the other HTTP codes, please see <a href="statuses.html">HTTP Status Response page </a>
        </p>

        <p>
            I have pages where you can practice your automation skills, the <a href="testPlaygroundPage.html">front end practice page</a>
            and the login scenario page at <a href="loginPage.html">fake login page</a><br>

            My github repo where I have various practices attempts is at <a href="https://github.com/fc572?tab=repositories">my github repo</a><br>

            I also tried using page object model and appium, so that I could give it a stub to mobile testing.
            The repo is at the URL above, the docs are at <a href="codeExplained.html">this page</a><br>

            Finally, there is a stub endpoint where you can practice your API skills, simply a POST and a GET.
            At this page you'll find the <a href="apiDocs.html">docs to a simplePOST and GET</a>
