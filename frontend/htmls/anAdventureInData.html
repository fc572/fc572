            A friend of mine came asking for help visualizing some data that he needed to attach to a presentation. 
            Of course, I was happy to help! Upon opening the file, I was presented with this:
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../images/data_adventure/start_data.png" alt="Screenshot of initial data, anonymized" width="700" height="400">
        </div>
        <p>
            And before you wonder — yes, of course, the data has been anonymized.

        <h3>Handling Multiline Data and Visualizing Trends in Onboarding</h3>
        <p>
            In data analysis, it's common to encounter complex datasets where cells contain multiple lines of information. 
            This post outlines how to clean, transform, and visualize such data using Python, focusing on onboarding statistics over time.
        </p>
        <h4>1. Loading and Cleaning Data</h4>
        <p>
            The process begins by loading the data from a CSV file and converting all values to strings. 
            This step ensures that mixed data types (e.g., numbers and text) are handled consistently.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Splitting Multiline Cells</h4>
        <p>
            Since each cell contains multiple lines of information, we split the cells by newline characters 
            and expand them into new rows. This results in a flattened dataset where each line becomes a separate row, 
            making further analysis possible.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Extrapolating Key Information</h4>
        <p>
            Next, we extract critical details, such as the year and specific onboarding counts, by slicing and transforming strings. 
            Columns are renamed, and irrelevant parts of the strings are discarded.
        </p>
        <h4>4. Filling Missing Values</h4>
        <p>
            Missing values in the "Answer options" column are filled by propagating the last known valid value. 
            Additionally, the answers are trimmed for clarity by removing any extraneous text in parentheses.
        </p>
        <h4>5. Summarizing the Data</h4>
        <p>
            A pivot table is created to summarize the onboarding data by year and answer option. 
            This table aggregates the counts of onboarded students and those who engaged in specific activities.
        </p>
        <h4>6. Visualizing the Results</h4>
        <p>
            Finally, a grouped bar chart is plotted to visualize the trends in onboarding and related activities over the years. 
            The chart clearly shows the distribution of responses, making it easy to interpret patterns at a glance.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../images/data_adventure/chart_visualisation.png" alt="Screenshot of bar chart" width="700" height="400">
        </div>
        <p>
            This structured approach, using Python’s powerful libraries like <code>pandas</code> and <code>matplotlib</code>, 
            offers a replicable framework for handling and visualizing complex datasets.
