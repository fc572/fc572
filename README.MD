This project forms my website which aims to be a collection of articles, and a training ground
for testers. I have build a page that can be used a training ground
for tools like Selenium or Playwright and another page
with similar functionality where a login workflow can be carried out.

The idea is to start small and to keep adding functionalities.
Please submit PRs if you like to contribute.

There are also a GET and POST endpoint that do nothing, but offer
the chance to practice with API tools like RestAssured.

Then becuase I use this as a practice ground myself, I have a 
backend section that uses serverless to configure a lambda in 
AWS. 
I have also a set of tests for frontend, backend and API. Actually
I have multiple versions of this, one within this project, and other
at the other repos in my github section.
